# NFC NDEF example

This is a sample app that shows how to read from and write to a NDEF formatted NFC tag. I tested it 
NTAG216 tags and it works properly when using tags with factory settings.

A NDEF formatted tag ("NFC Data Exchange Format") does need two separate files:
1 a Container file (""CC") that is selected by a NFC reader that holds a link to the
2 data file where all data are stored.
